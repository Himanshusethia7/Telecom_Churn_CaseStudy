# Telecom_Churn_CaseStudy

Objective:
The goal of this project is to predict churn among high-value customers (top 20% by revenue) in the telecom industry, with a focus on the Indian and Southeast Asian market. By identifying customers at high risk of leaving, the company can take proactive steps to retain them and minimize revenue loss.

1. Business Context
Churn Definition: In this case, churn is defined as usage-based: customers who have not made any calls or used mobile internet in the 9th month (churn phase).
High-value Customers: Customers who, in the first two months (Month 6 and 7), have recharge amounts above the 70th percentile of the average recharge amount.
Key Phases:
Good Phase (Month 6-7): Normal behavior.
Action Phase (Month 8): Signs of dissatisfaction.
Churn Phase (Month 9): Customer stops using services.
2. Data Preparation
a. Filter High-Value Customers
Step 1: Calculate the average recharge amount in Month 6 and 7.
Step 2: Define high-value customers as those above the 70th percentile.
Step 3: Filter the dataset to include only high-value customers.
b. Tag Churners
Churners: Customers with no calls or internet usage in Month 9.
Tag Churn (1) or Not Churned (0) based on usage in Month 9.
c. Feature Engineering
Create features like total calls, data usage, recharge frequency, and trends across months (e.g., drop in usage between Month 6-8).
d. Remove Month 9 Data
Drop all features for the churn phase (Month 9) as they are unavailable during prediction.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Churn Analysis: Examine churn distribution, usage patterns, and correlations.
Behavior Patterns: Compare usage between churners and non-churners, especially in the action phase.
Segmentation: Cluster customers to uncover patterns of churn.
4. Dimensionality Reduction with PCA
Normalize the data and apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality and retain the most important features for modeling.
5. Predictive Modeling
a. Model Selection
Logistic Regression: For interpretability and understanding feature importance.
Random Forests / XGBoost: For handling class imbalance and providing feature importance.
SVM: For high-dimensional data after PCA.
b. Handling Class Imbalance
Use oversampling (SMOTE), undersampling, or adjust class weights to address the churn imbalance (5-10% churn rate).
c. Evaluation Metrics
Precision, Recall, F1-Score: Prioritize recall (to minimize false negatives).
ROC-AUC: Measure the modelâ€™s ability to distinguish between churners and non-churners.
6. Feature Importance
Identify key features influencing churn using logistic regression coefficients or feature importance from tree-based models.
Visualize important features using Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs).
7. Model Selection and Finalization
Choose the model that provides the best balance between precision and recall, with a focus on minimizing churner misclassification.
8. Insights and Business Recommendations
Retention Strategies: Target high-risk customers with personalized offers or discounts.
Service Improvement: Address common issues driving churn, such as poor service quality or uncompetitive pricing.
Targeted Campaigns: Use model predictions to focus retention efforts on high-value customers at risk of leaving.
Conclusion
By leveraging machine learning for churn prediction, we can help telecom companies retain high-value customers and reduce revenue leakage. The insights gained from feature importance and customer behavior can guide strategies to improve service quality and offer tailored retention programs, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction and profitability.
