# Telecom_Churn_CaseStudy

To approach this telecom churn case study, we need to follow a structured process, starting with understanding the data and the business context, then using appropriate methods for predictive modeling and feature analysis. Below, I’ll walk through the steps based on the problem definition and objectives outlined.

1. Understanding the Business Context
The key business goal here is to predict which high-value customers are at risk of churning and to understand the factors that contribute to their decision to leave. Churn prediction is crucial for telecom companies because retaining high-value customers is much more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. By focusing on high-value customers (top 20% by revenue), telecom operators can significantly reduce revenue leakage.

Churn Definition:

Usage-based churn: A customer is considered to have churned if they did not engage in any usage (outgoing/incoming calls, mobile internet, etc.) in the 9th month.
High-value customers: Defined as customers whose recharge amounts in months 6 and 7 (the "good" phase) are above the 70th percentile.
Key Phases in Customer Lifecycle:

Good phase (Month 6-7): Normal behavior where the customer is satisfied with the service.
Action phase (Month 8): A phase where the customer’s dissatisfaction begins (e.g., they receive a better offer from a competitor, or experience poor service).
Churn phase (Month 9): The customer has stopped using services completely (no calls, no mobile internet).
The dataset contains customer usage information for four months, and the goal is to predict churn in the 9th month based on data from the first three months.

2. Data Preparation
We need to clean and prepare the dataset before building any predictive models.

a. Filter High-Value Customers
Step 1: Calculate the average recharge amount for each customer over the first two months (Month 6 and Month 7).
Step 2: Define high-value customers as those whose average recharge amount is greater than or equal to the 70th percentile of the average recharge amount of all customers.
Step 3: Filter the dataset to only include high-value customers.
b. Tag Churners
A customer is tagged as a churner (1) if they have not made any calls (incoming or outgoing) or used mobile internet in Month 9.
This requires checking the following attributes for Month 9:
total_ic_mou_9 (Total incoming minutes of use)
total_og_mou_9 (Total outgoing minutes of use)
vol_2g_mb_9 (2G data usage)
vol_3g_mb_9 (3G data usage)
If all these values are zero, the customer is considered to have churned.
c. Remove Attributes for Month 9
Once churners are tagged, drop all features related to Month 9 (e.g., total_ic_mou_9, total_og_mou_9, etc.), as they won't be available in the prediction phase.
d. Feature Engineering
Derive new features based on business understanding and customer behavior:
Usage metrics: Total usage in Month 6, 7, 8 (e.g., total_ic_mou_6, total_og_mou_7).
Behavioral metrics: A combination of calls, data usage, and recharge amounts over the first three months.
Customer engagement: Monthly recharge frequency, average minutes of use, and average data usage.
Customer trends: Changes in usage patterns over time (e.g., if data usage drops significantly between Month 6 and Month 8, this could indicate dissatisfaction).
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performing EDA will help identify potential patterns, correlations, and insights that will be useful for feature engineering and modeling:

Churn Rate Distribution: Explore the distribution of churners vs non-churners to understand class imbalance.
Usage Behavior: Compare the usage patterns (calls, data, recharge) between churners and non-churners in the “good” and “action” phases.
Customer Segmentation: Use clustering or visualizations (e.g., PCA, t-SNE) to segment customers based on their usage patterns and identify trends associated with churn.
Correlation Analysis: Explore correlations between features (e.g., total call minutes and churn).
4. Dimensionality Reduction Using PCA
Given the large number of features, we should apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality. PCA will help us identify the most important components of customer behavior that are correlated with churn, without losing much information.

Normalize the data before applying PCA (important because PCA is sensitive to the scale of the data).
Use PCA to transform the features into a set of linearly uncorrelated components, which can then be used for modeling.
5. Predictive Modeling
Now, we can start building machine learning models to predict churn. We'll explore different models and evaluate them based on their performance.

a. Model Selection
Logistic Regression: A simple yet effective model for binary classification problems, especially for interpreting feature importance.
Random Forests or XGBoost: Tree-based models that handle class imbalance well and provide feature importances.
Support Vector Machines (SVM): Effective in high-dimensional spaces, especially after PCA.
b. Handling Class Imbalance
Since churn is a rare event (5-10% churn rate), the data is imbalanced. We can apply the following techniques:

Resampling techniques: Either undersample the non-churners or oversample the churners.
Class weights adjustment: In algorithms like logistic regression, random forests, and SVM, we can adjust class weights to penalize misclassifying churners more than non-churners.
Synthetic Data Generation: Use techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to create synthetic churner instances.
c. Model Evaluation
We will evaluate models using classification metrics that prioritize recall (sensitivity) for churners:

Confusion Matrix: To visualize false positives and false negatives.
Precision, Recall, F1-Score: Especially recall to ensure we identify as many churners as possible.
ROC-AUC: To measure the model’s ability to distinguish between churners and non-churners.
6. Feature Importance
Once we have a model that performs well in predicting churn, we need to analyze which features are the most important for predicting churn. For this, we can use:

Feature importance in tree-based models like Random Forest or XGBoost.
Coefficient analysis for logistic regression models.
Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs): Visualizing the relationship between key features and churn.
7. Final Model Selection
Based on the evaluation metrics, choose the best model. A balance between precision and recall is ideal, but we should prioritize recall (i.e., minimizing false negatives) to ensure we don’t miss potential churners.

8. Insights and Business Recommendations
Based on the model results and feature analysis, provide actionable insights to the telecom company:

Customer Retention Strategies: Propose strategies to retain high-risk customers (e.g., special offers, service improvements).
Service Improvement: Identify areas where customers are dissatisfied (e.g., poor data speed, high charges, limited plan options).
Targeted Campaigns: Suggest which customers should be targeted with retention campaigns based on model predictions.
Conclusion
The goal of this project is not only to predict churn but also to understand the key drivers of churn among high-value customers. By applying machine learning techniques, dimensionality reduction (PCA), and proper handling of class imbalance, we can build an effective churn prediction model. The insights gained can help telecom companies better understand customer behavior and take targeted actions to improve customer retention and reduce revenue leakage.
